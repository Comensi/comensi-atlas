Community engagement, in this context, goes beyond simply ‘involving’ people. It relies on building ongoing, meaningful relationships between the community and organisations for mutually beneficial outcomes. It is a collaborative process between groups who are brought together as neighbours or through sharing a common interest or concern. It is a powerful vehicle for bringing about environmental and behavioural changes to improve the situation and wellbeing of the community. 

The toolkit comprises three parts:

- The COMENSI method - an overarching approach to community engagement to guide projects from the embryonic stage of development through to completion and evaluation.
- A collection of engagement methods, tools and techniques which include descriptions, guidelines and some practical use examples of where these have been applied.
- Local Framework Scenarios.
