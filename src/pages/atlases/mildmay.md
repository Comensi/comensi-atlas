The Mildmay ward of Islington, like many parts of London, has been subject to change, with gentrification being a cause for friction among residents. Many feel that their neighbourhood, and even their homes, are under threat of development as the cost of housing continues to rise. To ensure a sense of belonging, this atlas will seek to collect memories of the local community whilst involving them in the shaping of its future.
