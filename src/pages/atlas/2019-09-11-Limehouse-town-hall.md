**Limehouse Town Hall is a place where working artists and cultural producers, audiences and communities are supported to share ideas, try out new things, and imagine a better here and now.**

Housed in a grade II listed building, Limehouse Town Hall acts as a hub for creative and cultural activities. As one of the last remaining versatile and multi-purpose cultural spaces in the city, the town hall makes interesting things happen.

The Town Hall is an active, vibrant and supportive place that makes space for ideas and activities to develop at their own pace. Combining forces under the umbrella of Limehouse Town Hall Trust, its creative residents, past and present, make significant contributions to the cultural life and well being of the east end of London and beyond.

Limehouse Town Hall is a valuable civic resource underpinned by a belief that arts and culture can create progressive changes in individual lives and society.
