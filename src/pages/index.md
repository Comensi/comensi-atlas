The COMENSI toolkit is a collection of tools, methods and practices
  specifically designed and selected to improve the engagement of urban
  communities. It is written to support adult education providers, public
  administrators, community managers and every professional interested in
  activating participatory processes of community engagement in challenging
  urban settings.
   
  This platform aims to extend the COMENSI method with practical digital tools
  for collecting and exploring information about neighbourhoods and places.
