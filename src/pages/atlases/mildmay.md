The Mildmay ward of Islington sits on the boundary with Hackney. This area, like many in London, has been subject to many changes, with gentrification being a cause for friction among residents. Many residents in social housing feel that their neighbourhood, and even their homes, are under threat of development as the cost of housing continues to rise. To ensure a sense of belonging, this atlas will seek to collect memories of the local community whilst involving them in the shaping of its future.
