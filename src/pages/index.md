        Community engagement, in this context, goes beyond simply ‘involving’ people. It relies on building ongoing, meaningful relationships between the community and organisations for mutually beneficial outcomes. It is a collaborative process between groups who are brought together as neighbours or through sharing a common interest or concern. It is a powerful vehicle for bringing about environmental and behavioural changes to improve the situation and wellbeing of the community.

        The toolkit comprises three parts:

        * The COMENSI method - an overarching approach to community engagement to guide projects from the embryonic stage of development through to completion and evaluation
        * A collection of engagement methods, tools and techniques which include descriptions, guidelines and some practical use examples of where these have been applied
        * Local Framework Scenarios

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
