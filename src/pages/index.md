COMENSI combines tools, methods and practices specifically designed and selected to improve the engagement of urban communities. Our Toolkit is written to support adult education providers, public administrators, community managers and every professional interested in activating participatory processes of community engagement in challenging urban settings. This platform aims to extend the COMENSI method with practical digital tools for collecting and exploring information about neighbourhoods and places. The Neighbourhood Atlas is a tool that enables anyone to create, share and combine maps of places, chronograms and  collections of documents in the hope that they too can take part in shaping their reality.
