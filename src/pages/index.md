  title: The map becomes the the territory
  description: >
    As more and more of our world goes online, the information about an area
    increasingly comes to define that place. The act of creating a map changes
    the story told of a place, and in doing so, changes a little piece of
    reality. This ability to define what a neighbourhood is, what it's value is,
    what is important about it needs to be shared. 


    The Neighbourhood Atlas platform is a tool that enables anyone to create,
    share and combine maps of places, in the hope that they too can take part in
    shaping their reality.

  The COMENSI toolkit is a collection of tools, methods and practices
  specifically designed and selected to improve the engagement of urban
  communities. It is written to support adult education providers, public
  administrators, community managers and every professional interested in
  activating participatory processes of community engagement in challenging
  urban settings.

  This platform aims to extend the COMENSI method with practical digital tools
  for collecting and exploring information about neighbourhoods and places.

        Community engagement, in this context, goes beyond simply ‘involving’
        people. It relies on building ongoing, meaningful relationships between
        the community and organisations for mutually beneficial outcomes. It is
        a collaborative process between groups who are brought together as
        neighbours or through sharing a common interest or concern. It is a
        powerful vehicle for bringing about environmental and behavioural
        changes to improve the situation and wellbeing of the community.

        The toolkit comprises three parts:

        * The COMENSI method - an overarching approach to community engagement
        to guide projects from the embryonic stage of development through to
        completion and evaluation * A collection of engagement methods, tools
        and techniques which include descriptions, guidelines and some practical
        use examples of where these have been applied * Local Framework

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
