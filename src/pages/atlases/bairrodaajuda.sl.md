Atlas Bairro da Ajuda je namenjen beleženju spominov, zgodb, idej in želja prebivalcev Ajude, ki so bile zbrane tekom participatornih akcij oziroma laboratorijev z imenom "Ideje za desetletje", mentorskim programom in drugimi aktivnostmi v soseskem središču.

Ajuda je portugalski okraj v občini Lizbona, ki pripada zahodni coni prestolnice, z 2,88 km² površine in 15 617 prebivalci. 

The territory of Ajuda is social, economic, cultural and demographically very heterogeneous. Geographically, the territory has a difficult configuration on a hill side, with streams and discontinuities, reinforced throughout time by urban desorganisation and many private ‘walls’: a palace and half a dozen military and police quarters, churches and military hospitals – Ajuda's circulation and mobility  is difficult.  Ajuda confines with the 'posh' area of Restelo/Belém on one side and has three neighbourhoods classified by Lisbon's municipality as BIP – priority intervention. Two are social housing blocks with several social re-settlements – Casalinho and 2 de Maio – and the third, Rio Seco is an aged and urbanistically chaotic neighbourhood. Gentrification, pressed by real estate speculation and tourism is threatening the popular, low-income population and the relative demographic renovation of the last decade, as young people are no longer able to find a house here. Still, Ajuda has a ‘neighbourhood/bairro spirit’ and popular history, but was and still is a neighbourhood neglected by local and social policies. 4Change started intervention in Ajuda in 2014.
