The EU-funded project COmmunity ENgagement for Social Inclusion (COMENSI) combines tools, methods and practices aimed to improve the engagement of people living in disadvantaged urban communities. The project partners will test the method included in the Toolkit -which supports adult education providers, public administrators, community managers and other professionals to initiate participatory processes- in five challenging EU urban neighbourhoods. These practical experiences will be collated in the Atlas, a platform which enables to create, share and combine maps of places, timelines and collections of documents to support engagement. The final findings and recommendations will be shared in the Neighbourhood Hub Handbook.
