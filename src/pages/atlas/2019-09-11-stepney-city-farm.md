Stepney City Farm is a three acre working farm; a rural oasis, in the heart of Tower Hamlets. We give children and adults a chance to meet farm animals, learn how to grow food and try out arts and crafts. Every Saturday, the Farm hosts a popular Farmerâ€™s Market.

We have an extensive education programme, with over 5,000 school children and young people benefiting from funded classes, tours and projects each year.

We are an educational charity working to improve lives through farming; we provide a welcoming green space to bring together our diverse community, and cultivate wellbeing through high-welfare, environmentally-sustainable farming practices.

The Farm is free to all visitors and everyone is welcome.
